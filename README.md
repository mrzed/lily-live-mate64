Lily Linux Live Installable Mate x64

This is a debian based x64 live-build script set. I put it together to allow me to 
build\use\distribute my basic Linux desktop that I use frequently. It doesn't have
many frills, but it has the basics I need. Modify as you need. I have built the
same version but using xfce4 instead of Mate.
